### **Task 2: Incident Reporting Tool**

Add this to your readme file.

#### **Story:**

You are tasked with developing an **Incident Reporting Tool** using **Angular** for the front end and **Firebase** for backend services. The application is designed to streamline the reporting and resolution of incidents within an organization, ensuring efficient role-based workflows.

---

### **Story Flow**

#### **1. Project Setup (10%)**

- Use Angular as the front-end framework and Firebase for authentication, Firestore as the database, and Firebase Hosting for deployment.
- Configure Firebase services to handle authentication and real-time data synchronization.
- Install a UI library of your choice (Angular Material, Tailwind CSS, or Ionic) for styling and UI components.

---

#### **2. Authentication & Authorization (15%)**

- **Login Scenarios:**

  1. **Scenario 1:** A user logs in with their mobile number and receives an OTP. After entering the correct OTP, they are directed to their dashboard based on their role (Admin or Reporter).
  2. **Scenario 2:** A user logs in with an invalid OTP, and an error message is displayed.

- **Auth Guards:**
  - Protect admin routes like **incident assignment and resolution**.
  - Restrict reporters to their own incident reports.

---

#### **3. User Interface (15%)**

- **Admin UI Features:**

  - Dashboard: Displays all incidents categorized by status (Open, In Progress, Resolved).
  - Forms for assigning incidents to reporters and marking incidents as resolved.
  - List of reporters with their assigned incidents.

- **Reporter UI Features:**

  - Dashboard: Displays incidents reported by them with details like description, priority, and status.
  - Ability to update the status of incidents (e.g., "In Progress") and add comments.

- **UI Expectations:**
  - Use a clean and responsive design.
  - Include visual indicators for incident priority (e.g., Low, Medium, High).

---

#### **4. Problem Solving (15%)**

- Implement logic for **incident reporting and tracking**:

  - Admins can view all incidents and assign them to reporters.
  - Reporters can update incident statuses and add resolution comments.

- **Edge Case Handling:**
  - Prevent duplicate incident reports by validating the description and reporter information.
  - Ensure reporters cannot edit or delete incidents assigned to others.

---

#### **5. Role-Based CRUD Operations (10%)**

- Admins can:

  - Create, view, and assign incidents.
  - Resolve incidents.

- Reporters can:
  - Report new incidents.
  - Update the status and add comments to their assigned incidents.

---

#### **6. Angular & TypeScript Concepts (10%)**

- **Services:** Create `IncidentService` and `AuthService` for managing incidents and authentication.
- **Interfaces:** Define `Incident` and `User` interfaces for strongly typed data models.
- **Lifecycle Hooks:** Use `ngOnInit` to fetch incidents and users.
- **Pipes:** Create a custom pipe to filter incidents by priority or status.

---

#### **7. Coding Standards (10%)**

- Follow Osmosys Angular standards for:
  - Modular structure: Separate modules for authentication and incident management.
  - Consistent naming conventions.
  - Clear and concise comments for code readability.

---

#### **8. Code Quality (5%)**

- Focus on reusability:
  - Use shared components for incident cards and forms.
  - Implement reusable validation logic for forms.

---

#### **9. Deployment & Submission (10%)**

- Deploy the application using Firebase Hosting.
- Use Git for version control with regular commits and well-written commit messages.
- Submit the project by pushing the code to a GitHub repository.

## **Evaluation Criteria and Rules**

To successfully complete the assigned project and achieve a passing score, developers must adhere to the following evaluation criteria. Each criterion is designed to assess specific skills and competencies in Angular and Firebase development, along with adherence to coding standards and best practices.
